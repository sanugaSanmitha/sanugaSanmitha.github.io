<h1> Firewall 	</h1>

<div id="hi">
<p>A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls 
incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined 
security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a 
trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the 
Internet.<ul>
<li>A firewall is a device, or a piece of software that is placed between your computer and the rest </li>
of the network (where the hackers are!)
<li> If you wish to protect your whole LAN from hackers out on the Internet, you would place a 
firewall between the LAN and the Internet connection.</li>
