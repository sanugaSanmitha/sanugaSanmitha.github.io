<p>Two Factor Authentication, also known as 2FA, two step verification is an extra layer of 
security that is known as "multi factor authentication" that requires not only a password 
and username but also something that only, and only, that user has on them,
<br>
There are three common factors used for authentication:

<ul>
<li>Something you know (such as a password)
 </li>
<li> Something you have (such as a smart card).</li>
<li> Something you are (such as a fingerprint or other biometric method)</li>
</ul>
